* customer requests shipment
* vendor drafts the multisig txset and sends to customer with tracking/delivery info
* order arrives, customer releases signed txset to vendor
* vendor signs and submits signed txset
* in case of dispute the adjudicator can sign multisig txset for customer refund
  or if the customer doesn't release payment after delivery
